<p>Many people have good ideas that are never accepted because there is not a community of people to begin applying an idea and making it the standard way of doing business.  Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN at the time, which is a particle physics laboratory in Switzerland, and he saw his invention as a tool for scientists to exchange ideas and support advanced research.    Berners-Lee’s idea took hold because the people whom HTML was first introduced to were technically-able and they saw that they could actually use it  because they understood, as Berners-Lee tells it, “Much of the crucial information existed only in people’s heads” (Berners-Lee and Fischetti 9). This community of people saw the value of exchanging information to advance scientific discovery.</p>
