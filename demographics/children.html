  <h4 style="text-align: center;">Effects on Children/Students</h4>

  <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">The transition to online schooling resulted in a widespread regression amongst 
        students, both academically and socially. Older students generally saw a decline in grades and test scores, while younger 
        students experienced difficulties reintegrating with society as establishments reopened.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Among college students, the average 
    GPA dropped by 0.2 points and average weekly study time decreased by 0.91 hours between the Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 
    semesters. There were also increases in delayed graduation, class withdrawal, and major change rates. College students 
    also faced several difficulties outside of the classroom, including a decline in employment rates, weekly hours, and 
    weekly earnings, as well as an increase in termination rates. Simultaneously, these college 
    students reported an increase in several mental health issues, as seen in <a href="#figure2.4">Figure 2.4</a> below. </p>


          <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2.4 </h3>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3.0em;"><a name="figure2.4"><img src="../images/image8.png" style="width: 670; height: 400;"> </a></p>
      

    
        
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Each of these issues is directly correlated 
        with the COVID-19 pandemic. 46 percent of students reported that their home was a distracting environment and not suitable to 
        work in, causing difficulties with concentration. 50 percent of students reported sleeping and waking up later than they did 
        prior to the pandemic. 26 percent of students reported dietary changes caused by a lack of nutritious food and the increased 
        availability of snacks. Finally, 33 percent of students with depressive or suicidal thoughts attributed those feelings to 
        loneliness.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">A study by the Department of Education <a href="../workscited.html#source12">(DoE, 2021)</a>
        on the effects of the pandemic on primary and secondary school students reported a 3-month and 1.5-month average 
        learning loss in math and reading, respectively. Simultaneously, 80 percent of students reported that the COVID-19 
        pandemic negatively impacted their mental health. They can be attributed to 3 main causes: a decrease in the quality 
        of education, a lack of supervision, and a loss of academic resources. </p>

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Students with in-person learning 
        <a href="../glossary.html#modality_def">modalities</a> were far more likely to report a satisfactory education than students with online learning modalities 
        (85 vs 28 percent). School districts acknowledged this decline in quality, as over 85 percent of districts with online 
        learning modalities reported a decrease of over 1 hour in instructional time, and 17 percent of districts even admitted 
        that the instruction their students were receiving was designed to review and retain old skills rather than learn new ones. 
        Teachers were also inadequately prepared to deal with online learning, as only 68 percent of teachers received training on 
        using computers for instruction, and only 26 percent of those teachers said that the training they received was actually 
        helpful (DoE, 2021).</p>
        
        <a href="www.wesh.com/article/central-florida-missing-students-covid-19/35549690#" target="_blank"><p class="leftpquote1"> "Orange County Public Schools witnessed a 145 percent 
          increase in truancy between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years" </p></a>
          
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">The failure of parents to properly 
          supervise their children in lieu of teachers also led to these drops in grades and mental health. The average absence rate 
          increased from 6 to 10 percent during the pandemic, and while many of these absences can be attributed to sickness, truancy 
          has become drastically more commonplace as well (DoE, 2021). In fact, Orange County Public Schools witnessed a 145 percent 
          increase in truancy between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years <a href="../workscited.html#source11">(Dutes, 2021)</a>. This is problematic as for all American 
          students under the age of 18, there is a direct negative correlation between absences per semester and GPA. </p>

          

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Finally, many public school students 
          had to rely on school resources in order to remain engaged in online learning formats. 59 percent of public school students 
          relied on computers provided by their school district while 4 percent relied on Internet access provided by the district 
          (DoE, 2021). However, it’s typical for these resources to be of low quality and end up providing students with little to 
          no aid in the long run.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Lockdown due to COVID-19 also seemed to harshly 
          impact the social development of children. Being stuck at home drastically reduces the opportunities children have to interact with 
          and learn about their environment. It also prevents them from being influenced by sources other than their family, which in 
          turn inhibits self-discovery. Older children and teenagers have less to worry about since they are generally capable of 
          remaining in contact with their friends through online platforms, but younger children typically don’t have that luxury, 
          and their brains are generally more malleable than average, which only exacerbates the effects.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">Finally, just as in adults, the 
            negative effects of online learning on mental health seem to be intensified in students from marginalized communities. The 
            GPA gap between high-income and low-income college students nearly doubled during the pandemic from 0.052 to 0.098. 
            Students of color were already more likely than white students to come from school districts with fewer resources 
            but to make matters worse, these students were also more likely to need to rely on resources provided by 
            these districts for online school. These students also exhibited higher rates of loss of motivation or focus 
            than white students. Similarly, LGBTQ+ students were more likely to lose motivation or focus and were also more likely 
            to experience feelings of loneliness than cis-gendered heterosexual students.</p>
