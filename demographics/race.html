    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Effects by Race/Ethnicity</h4>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The effects of the pandemic also appear to be amplified or reduced depending on race. 
            <a href="#figure2.3a">Figure 2.3a</a> below shows that the COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 people was generally 
            greater in people of indigenous, black, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latinx descent than white 
            and Asian Americans from December 2020 to March 2021 <a href="../workscited.html">(Clary & Liao, 2021)</a>. </p>


            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2.3a </h3>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><a name="figure2.3a"><img src="../images/image7.png" style="width: 700; height: 345;"> </a></p>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;">This isn’t the first disease to have varied impacts depending on race.
             In fact, several common diseases such as influenza, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension all seem 
             to disproportionately affect certain demographics. Many medical professionals believe that these 
             discrepancies can be attributed to innate vulnerabilities in certain races. It was found that 23 
             percent of medical students believed and endorsed baseless claims about racial variations in the 
             human anatomy, including that white people are less susceptible to heart disease than black people, 
             that white people have larger brains than black people, and that black people have thicker skin 
             than white people (Hall et al., 2015). </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">However, if these claims about the link between racial disparities in mortality rates and genetic 
            vulnerability were true, there’d at least be some sort of variety by disease as to which races are the 
            most vulnerable, seeing as how it wouldn’t make sense for the same few groups to be constantly targeted 
            by a plethora of diverse conditions. However, in all cases, there is no variation in which groups are 
            especially affected, as people of black or indigenous descent always exhibited higher mortality rates 
            than those of white or Asian descent. Additionally, a similar skewing of the COVID-19 mortality rate can 
            be seen in Figure 2.3b below, which shows that 67.5 percent of the coronavirus-related deaths between March 
            and September 2020 were of people from households below the United States’ median income (Health Affairs [HA], 2021).</p>
