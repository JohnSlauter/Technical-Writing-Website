    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Effects by Race/Ethnicity</h4>

        <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 75px;">The effects of the pandemic also appear to be amplified or reduced depending on race. 
            <a href="#figure2.3a">Figure 2.3a</a> below shows that the COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 people was generally 
            greater in people of indigenous, black, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latinx descent than white 
            and Asian Americans from December 2020 to March 2021 <a href="../workscited.html#source7">(Clary & Liao, 2021)</a>. </p>


            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2.3a </h3>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3.0em;"><a name="figure2.3a"><img src="../images/image7.png" style="width: 700; height: 345;"> </a></p>

        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296"><p class="leftpquote1"> "23 percent of medical students believed and endorsed baseless claims about racial 
          variations in the human anatomy" </p></a>
          
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">This isn’t the first disease to have varied impacts depending on race.
             In fact, several common diseases such as influenza, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension all seem 
             to disproportionately affect certain demographics. Many medical professionals believe that these 
             discrepancies can be attributed to innate vulnerabilities in certain races. It was found that 23 
             percent of medical students believed and endorsed baseless claims about racial variations in the 
             human anatomy, including that white people are less susceptible to heart disease than black people, 
             that white people have larger brains than black people, and that black people have thicker skin 
             than white people <a href="../workscited.html#source14">(Hall et al., 2015)</a>. However, if these claims about the link between racial disparities in mortality rates and genetic 
             vulnerability were true, there’d at least be some sort of variety by disease as to which races are the 
             most vulnerable, seeing as how it wouldn’t make sense for the same few groups to be constantly targeted 
             by a plethora of diverse conditions. However, in all cases, there is no variation in which groups are 
             especially affected, as people of black or indigenous descent always exhibited higher mortality rates 
             than those of white or Asian descent. Additionally, a similar skewing of the COVID-19 mortality rate can 
             be seen in <a href="#figure2.3b">Figure 2.3b</a> below, which shows that 67.5 percent of the coronavirus-related deaths between March 
             and September 2020 were of people from households below the United States’ median income <a href="../workscited.html#source15"> (Health Affairs [HA], 2021) </a>.</p>

        
             <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2.3b </h3>

             <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3.0em;"><a name="figure2.3b"><img src="../images/image6.png" style="width: 741; height:416;"> </a></p>

             <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;"> COVID-19 also had a drastically higher mortality 
              rate in those with occupations without work-from-home options than in those whose occupations had 
              work-from-home options (19.14 vs 10.90 deaths / 100,000 people), which obviously disproportionately 
              affected blue-collar workers over white-collar workers<a href="../workscited.html#source15"> (HA, 2021) </a>.
             </p>
             <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">
              Therefore, this discrepancy can be attributed to systemic racism and a lack of resources rather than 
              genetic vulnerability. A study on health coverage by <a href="../workscited.html#source3">Samantha Artiga (2021)</a> shows that uninsured people 
              have a COVID mortality rate almost double that of insured people (27.57 vs 15.50 deaths / 100,000 people), 
              and people of color exhibit much higher uninsured rates than white people do (14.6 vs 7.8 percent). A 
              study of physicians in the Washington area reveals the reason for this, showing that 90 percent of 
              doctors adjusted their clinical decisions based on their patient’s insurance status.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">
              It is important to note that inequality across healthcare isn’t merely restricted by classism. Even 
              after acquiring the resources necessary for proper medical care, black and indigenous people remain 
              victims of medical racism. In fact, black people in households above 400 percent of the median income 
              still had a COVID-19 mortality rate that was still 3.5 times higher than that of white people in 
              households below the median income (Clary & Liao, 2021). This can be linked to high levels of racial 
              bias in doctors, particularly white doctors, who make up 56.2 percent of America’s doctor population. 
              Racial biases are biases that one may develop implicitly as a result of consistent exposure to racist 
              stereotypes in their community or the media they consume. Over 70 percent of Americans demonstrate racial 
              biases, but what’s more interesting is that about 85 percent of these same Americans believe that 
              they hold no racial biases <a href="../workscited.html#source16"> (Horowitz et al, 2019)</a>. While racial bias in the medical field would be 
              less of an issue if the doctor population was more heterogeneous, it’s currently dominated by white 
              people as I previously mentioned. What’s worse is that, when prescribing painkillers like oxycodone 
              or ibuprofen, white doctors were more likely to accurately prescribe to patients of their own race 
              over others than black patients were <a href="../workscited.html#source16"> (Hall et al., 2015)</a>. This means that not only do white doctors 
              have the most influence in the medical field, but they also exhibit the most bias in it as well.
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">
              In addition to the medical field, the general population has also contributed to the amplified 
              marginalization of certain races due to COVID-19. <a href="#figure2.3c">Figure 2.3c</a> below shows how people of color, 
              especially Asians, have witnessed a drastic increase in racism against their race since the start 
              of the pandemic <a href="../workscited.html#source23">(Ruiz et al., 2020)</a>.
               </p>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2.3c </h3>

             <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3.0em;"><a name="figure2.3c"><img src="../images/image6.png" style="width: 741; height:416;"> </a></p>

             <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">

              More specifically, black, Asian, and Hispanic Americans all claimed at higher rates than white people 
              that since the pandemic started, they were more likely to have people of other races act uncomfortable 
              around them, be subject to racial slurs or racist jokes, fear someone might threaten or physically attack 
              them, or worry that others would be suspicious of them for wearing a mask. It is important to note that 
              for black Americans specifically, many of these increases could also be linked to the May 2020 murder of 
              George Floyd and subsequent turmoil, as well as the revitalization of the Black Lives Matter and, in 
              response, All Lives Matter movements.

              The effects of both general and medical racism on mental health can be seen in the ethnic and racial 
              disparities of the causes of psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. While white adults 
              exhibited higher rates of general issues such as feelings of isolation, concerns regarding the health 
              of loved ones, or fear of contracting coronavirus, black and Hispanic adults exhibited larger amounts of 
              concern about more specific issues, like workplace exposure to coronavirus, housing instability, and the 
              death of loved ones <a href="../workscited.html#source20">(Mcknight-Eily et al., 2020)</a>.
