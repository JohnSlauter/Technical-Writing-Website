    <p class = center>One major cause of anxiety during the pandemic was the lack of information regarding the Coronavirus. Due to the novelty of the virus, very little was known about it during the onset of the pandemic. As a result, public health officials frequently issued new recommendations that were completely opposed to previous recommendations. Although revision is a natural part of the scientific method, some unfamiliar with the concept can interpret the changes as a sign that health experts are not reliable. In addition to the updates made to guidelines as research on the virus progressed, the politicization of the virus by many officials further obfuscated the severity of the pandemic. Efforts to conceal the potential severity of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic also contributed to the climate of uncertainty.
    </p>
    
    <p class = center>The most significant factor in creating the climate of uncertainty was the continuous pushback of the estimated return to pre-coronavirus life; in many areas throughout the country, lockdown measures, which were initially scheduled to last two weeks, are still in place. Intolerance of uncertainty, a personality trait characterized by an inability to cope with uncertainty, has been found to correlate with both serious physical and mental health conditions. According to researchers from the Huazhong University of Science, “Numerous researches showed that generalized anxiety, depression, or other mental health problems were significantly associated with [intolerance of uncertainty] among a broad range of samples, such as mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder, public safety personnel, women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, pregnant women, and men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. Furthermore, a high level of IU scores implicated serious psychological problems” (Zhuo, 2021). The researchers conducted a survey of college students returning to class in Wuhan, China and found that, “Fear of the unknown and excessive worry always results in severe self-pressure and loneliness, which triggers physical sensations related to anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic” (Zhuo, 2021).
