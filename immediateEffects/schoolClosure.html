    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Closure of Schools and Colleges</h4>


    <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">About a month after the first 
      confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States in late January 2020, Nancy Messonier, director of the CDC’s National 
      Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned schools to prepare for the spread of coronavirus and to 
      consider limiting interaction between students or closing and transitioning to “internet-based teleschooling.” A 
      week later, Northshore School District in Washington, populated with 24,000 students, closes all public schools and 
      shifts to online learning. Another week later, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and within the week nearly 40 
      million students had been sent home as a result of school closures <a href="../workscited.html#source28">(Takahama, 2020)</a>. By the start of the 2021-2022 
      school year, the National Center for Education Statistics shows that 67 percent of adults with children enrolled in 
      an in-person school had reported a transition to some sort of distance-learning format <a href="../workscited.html#source8">(NCES, 2021)</a>. Geographically, 
      colleges and universities closed in a very similar fashion to schools, with the University of Washington being the 
      first major school to cancel in-person classes for nearly 50,000 students and switch to a fully online format  
      (Takahama, 2020). Several schools followed, closing classroom buildings, on-campus facilities, and even evacuating dorms.</p>
