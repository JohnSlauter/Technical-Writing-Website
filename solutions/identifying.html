    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Identifying Issues</h4>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">In order to properly treat mental health 
  issues and disorders, one must first be aware that they are present. Online mental health screening tests exist for depression, 
  anxiety, psychosis, and several other issues that have been exhibited by the population more frequently since the start of the 
  pandemic. These tests ask whether you’ve experienced various symptoms linked with a certain issue and to what extent. While by 
  no means are these tests a valid substitute for a professional diagnosis, they are quick and easy ways to determine whether or 
  not one should take the time to seek professional help. Periodically assessing your own mental health can also help to prevent 
  the onset or relapse of a mental illness. To take an online mental health assessment on <a href="https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/" target="_blank">Mental Health America</a>, which has been 
  endorsed by several physicians, one can: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Go to their website </p></li>
    <li>Select the quiz that they believe applies to them </p></li>
    <li>Complete the test </p></li>
      <li>Take the “Mental Health Next Steps” quiz once finished with the first quiz.</p></li>
</ul>
  
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Getting Professional Help</h4>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">
    One of the best ways to improve mental health issues you may be experiencing is to speak to licensed professionals, such as primary care doctors, therapists, or psychiatrists.  Professionals will better be able to diagnose symptoms as signs of a mental disorder or as a reaction to traumatic experience and will be able to recommend the best steps forward for your specific situation.  All situations are unique when it comes to mental health, so speaking to a health care professional about your specific issues will be the best way to get the best care possible.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em; text-indent: 75px; margin-left: 30px;">
    Access to mental health counseling was improved during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the necessary place lawmakers understood it would have in public health during the lockdowns.  Once the state of emergency was enacted, telehealth, which is what online doctor’s visits and online therapy appointments fall under, was given much more leeway in what it could do, such as offer care across state lines.  Medicare also provided reimbursements for most forms of telehealth, from psychiatric assessment to medical screenings and even group therapy <a href="../workscited.html#source2">(AHCA, 2020)</a>.  While this helped with access to mental health care without having to leave the house, many people still found that they could not afford mental health care, especially since these people may have just lost their jobs and/or health insurance.  Additionally, many people still have a stigma against mental health care and therapy in general, thinking it’s only for people who aren’t normal or are seriously mentally ill.  These stigmas keep people from choosing to get help with mental issues.  One of the main things we can tell you overall that will help your mental health is that it is normal to have mental distress, and that it is healthy and important to address it, either with people you trust or with health care professionals like a therapist.  While most people don’t develop serious mental illnesses, we believe that everyone could benefit from some time with a therapist, just to take time to think about your mental health and work on weaknesses.  As an option to get people started, we have developed a short instruction set that can help people suffering mental distress find the resources they need.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Realize that it’s okay to not be okay.  Everyone has tough periods, especially during Covid, and it’s okay to seek help.</li></br>
    <li>Speak to someone you trust (if you feel comfortable with this).  It is likely that other people in your life have gone through similar emotions, so finding people that can support you during this process can help a lot.</li></br>
    <li>Find resources online.  There are many resources you can find online regarding mental health, which range from tips you can try on your own to therapists and psychiatrists in your area you can set up appointments with.  UCF CAPS has a great info page which we have cited in our works cited section, but includes Covid-specific coping mechanisms, general stress and anxiety management tips, and resources from the APA <a href="../workscited.html#source6">(CAPS, n.d.)</a>.</li></br>

      <ul>
