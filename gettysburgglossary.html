<h3>Glossary and Commentary</h3>

<p><a name="def1"><b>Anxiety</b></a>: is the body’s reaction to stressful or unfamiliar situations.  Small doses of anxiety are normal and can help us overcome hardship by keeping us alert and aware of our surroundings.  However, when anxiety persists for extended periods of time or occurs for no discernable reason, this is considered an anxiety disorder and can cause significant distress and affect many parts of the person’s life.  Anxiety disorders can be general, where an excessive level of fear or anxiety shows itself in many different situations consistently, obsessive-compulsive, where the anxieties arise around obsessive thoughts that trigger compulsive behaviors, or trauma and stressor related, where the anxiety is related to a specific event or change in a person’s life that has caused significant anxiety.

<p><a name="def1"><b>Comorbidity</b></a>: describes when a person has two or more disorders or illnesses at the same time.  Specifically, it often describes when the disorders or illnesses worsen the course of the other, or when having one makes it much more likely to contract the other.  Many mental illnesses show comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression or substance use disorders and mental disorders in general.  Schizophrenia is also comorbid with both mental and substance use disorders.
